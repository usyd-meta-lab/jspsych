# Contingency Learning Task
A contingency learning task (e.g. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s41235-020-00237-2">Double et al. 2020</a>) using a medical cover story. Can easily implement outcome and cue frequency effects. Categorical feedback is currently used (e.g. recover vs did not recover)

Currently, the task is programmed to randomly allocate particpants to an outcome density condition (high vs low) and to a rating condition (CR vs control)
