  <p style="font-weight: 400;">Thank you for completing the research study understanding emotion regulation. This study aims to understand the strategies people use to try and help others manage their emotions.</p>
  <p style="font-weight: 400;">We told you that you would be participating with another participant, and that you would be providing help to this person as they viewed negative stimuli. In fact, <strong><u>there was no other person viewing negative stimuli</u></strong>. The feedback you saw was generated by the experimenter. This deception was necessary in order to allow us to control what feedback you received about each piece of advice you offered. This allows us to study in a controlled way how various factors combine to determine which strategies people use to help others and whether they think a strategy works.</p>
  <p style="font-weight: 400;">If you have any questions, now or at a later time, please feel free to contact Dr Kit Double (<a href="mailto:kit.double@sydney.edu.au">kit.double@sydney.edu.au</a>)</p>
