/* 
Overall Structure
•	141 items
•	8 tasks grouped into 4 branches, based on the four-branch model of emotional intelligence:
1.	Perceiving Emotions
2.	Using Emotions to Facilitate Thought
3.	Understanding Emotions
4.	Managing Emotions

Each branch has two tasks, so the 8 tasks together cover the model.

Branch 1: Perceiving Emotions
1.	Faces Task – judge emotions expressed in human faces.
2.	Pictures Task – judge emotions conveyed in abstract designs, landscapes, or pictures.

⸻

Branch 2: Using Emotions (Facilitating Thought)
3.	Sensations Task – identify the emotions associated with different physical sensations (e.g., colors, sounds, temperatures).
4.	Facilitation Task – evaluate which moods/emotions would best facilitate certain kinds of problem solving or reasoning.

⸻

Branch 3: Understanding Emotions
5.	Changes Task – recognize how emotions evolve and transition over time (e.g., how irritation may progress to anger).
6.	Blends Task – identify complex emotions that arise from combinations of simpler emotions.

⸻

Branch 4: Managing Emotions
7.	Emotion Management Task – evaluate the effectiveness of strategies for managing one’s own emotions.
8.	Emotional Relationships Task – evaluate strategies for managing emotions in others or in social interactions.

  <h2>Instructions</h2>

  <p>Welcome, and thank you for taking part in this study.<br>
  You are about to complete the Mayer&#8211;Salovey&#8211;Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test (MSCEIT). 
  This test is designed to measure different ways in which people understand, use, and manage emotions.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The test is <strong>not a measure of personality or general intelligence</strong>, but rather of specific emotional abilities.</li>
    <li>There are several types of questions, such as:
      <ul>
        <li>Describing the emotions that different situations or pictures might cause.</li>
        <li>Identifying how emotions can change or blend together.</li>
        <li>Considering how emotions might help someone think or solve a problem.</li>
        <li>Judging the most effective way to regulate emotions in a scenario.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Some items will ask you to rate answers on a <strong>scale</strong> (e.g., how effective or how likely), while others will ask you to <strong>select the best option</strong> from a list.</li>
    <li>There are no trick questions. The aim is to record your <strong>first, honest judgment</strong>. Try not to overthink your answers.</li>
    <li>Work at a steady pace. While there is no strict time limit for most sections, the whole test usually takes about <strong>30&#8211;45 minutes</strong> to complete.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Please answer <strong>as carefully and honestly as possible</strong>, since the value of the test depends on your genuine responses.</p>
